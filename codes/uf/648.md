# 684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of* `n` *nodes*. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

## Solution

这个问题还是直接用`union-find`就行。

```c++
class UnionFind {
private:
    vector<int> root;
    int cnt;

public:
    explicit UnionFind(int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) root.push_back(i);
        cnt = n;
    }

    void union_(int x, int y) {
        int root_x = find(x);
        int root_y = find(y);

        if (root_x != root_y) {
            root[root_x] = root_y;
            cnt--;
        }
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (root[x] != x) root[x] = find(root[x]);

        return root[x];
    }

    bool is_connected(int x, int y) { return find(x) == find(y); }

    int get_cnt() const { return cnt; }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        auto res = vector<int>();

        auto uf = UnionFind(edges.size() + 1);

        for (vector<int>& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];

            if (uf.is_connected(u, v)) {
                res.push_back(u);
                res.push_back(v);
                break;
            }

            uf.union_(u, v);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
